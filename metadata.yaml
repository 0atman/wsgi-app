summary: A charm for running Python WSGI applications
maintainer: Robin Winslow <robin.winslow@canonical.com>
description: |
  This charm should be able to serve most simple WSGI applications.
  It can hook into postgresql or mongodb databases (whose locations
  will be available to the app as DATABASE_URL and MONGO_URL environment
  variables), provides HTTP interfaces for load-balancing, and you can
  pass any extra environment variables for your application
  through the environment_variables config option.
